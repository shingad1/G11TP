			<h1>A week before!</h1>
			<p>26/11/18</p>
		</header>
		<p> Only a week left and we still have a lot of work to do! So it was time to be realistic.
			This week we rearranged our schedules and what we initially planned to get done for the MVP and increased our meeting hours. </p>
		<p>The storyline and scene images are all complete, the only issue now is figuring out how to implement the scene images into the start of our game. </p>
		<p> Dialogue was one of our main feature we wanted to get done for this week. However, it was underestimated how long it would take as there were struggles
				with the implementation so this feature will be carried over to the next week.</p>
		<p>Graphics team created a band new map for our candy planet, which is looking very sweet!</p>
		<p> The website made great progress this week. The responsiveness issues with the text box on the blog page was fixed, slide show is finally showing off
				screenshots of our game. All that is left now is  to fix the text on the home page.</p>

			<h1>Slowly but surely</h1>
			<p>19/11/18</p>
		</header>
		<p>Having had a productive previous week and progressed with the animations and interactions between characters our to-do list was looking slightly less overwhelming.
			This week the player and NPC interaction was completed, there was also a few improvements made by the graphics team with the enemy character. </p>
		<p>As a group we came up with a vague story line for our opening scene, then a few of us went away to refine the story and draw up a storyboard
			 with the associated dialogue. </p>
		<p> So far so good with the game website, with all the sections set up all that’s left to do is fill them with our content.
				 However, we are having some issues with its responsiveness. This will be our main and hopefully the last step to completing the website.</p>

			<h1>What’s the Plan?  </h1>
			<p>12/11/18</p>
		</header>
		<p>This week we set up an action plan. This firstly started off very optimistically until we began a never ending list of things we needed to get done for the the Minimum
				Viable Product (MVP) presentation, and how much time this would take. With these tasks we all decided as a group the priorities of the tasks. The Deadlines we gave
				to these tasks were dependent on the priorities. </p>
		<p> The high priority tasks included animations, interaction and dialogue between characters, battle algorithms and the opening scene.
				It was decided to focus on these tasks first as we knew it would require some research and tutorials in order to implement them.</p>
		<p>Alongside  this, the graphics team began creating maps and  player / NPC sprite sheets. This is an ongoing task as we will require
			 new maps for the different planets and potential character updates. </p>
