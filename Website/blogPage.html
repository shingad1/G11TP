			<h1>Whatâ€™s the Plan?  </h1>
			<p>12/11/18</p>
		</header>
		<p>This week we set up an action plan. This firstly started off very optimistically until we began a never ending list of things we needed to get done for the the Minimum
				Viable Product (MVP) presentation, and how much time this would take. With these tasks we all decided as a group the priorities of the tasks. The Deadlines we gave
				to these tasks were dependent on the priorities. </p>
		<p> The high priority tasks included animations, interaction and dialogue between characters, battle algorithms and the opening scene.
				It was decided to focus on these tasks first as we knew it would require some research and tutorials in order to implement them.</p>
		<p>Alongside  this, the graphics team began creating maps and  player / NPC sprite sheets. This is an ongoing task as we will require
			 new maps for the different planets and potential character updates. </p>
